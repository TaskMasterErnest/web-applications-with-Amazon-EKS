# web-applications-with-Amazon-EKS
A repo containing code on an introduction to building container web application based on Amazon EKS.

The code follows an Amazon workshop event on Building Web Applications based on Amazon EKS. The code is open source and I will be using it an making changes only when it does not suit the environment I am working in.

The preferred environment to work in is the AWS Cloud9 environment but I am trying out Gitpod to cut costs.
